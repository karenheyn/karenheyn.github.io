      <h1>Hello world, I'm Karen</h1>
      <br />
      <p>
        I am a full-stack developer that loves building clean, mobile-friendly
        UIs, and backends to power them. I have a passion for learning and am
        always planning out my next project & teaching myself new technologies.
        <br />
        <br /> Before I learned how to code at General Assembly, I studied
        philosophy at Penn State while working as a Bartender and Field
        Marketing Specialist. I graduated cum laude December 2017 and spent most
        of 2018 backpacking through Europe.
        <br />
        <br />
        When i'm not coding, you will likely find me in the kitchen trying new
        recipes.
